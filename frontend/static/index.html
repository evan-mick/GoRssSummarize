                        <p class="summary">Republican attorneys general from 17 states have filed a lawsuit challenging new federal regulations that entitle workers to time off and other accommodations for abortions. The lawsuit alleges that the rules, finalized on Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), exceed the scope of the 2022 Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed with bipartisan support. The regulations, which go into effect on June 18th, allow workers to seek time off to obtain and recover from an abortion. The lawsuit argues that the regulations force employers to accommodate abortions, even if they are illegal under state law. The EEOC maintains that the regulations only provide for time off, which does not have to be paid. The lawsuit was led by Tennessee and Arkansas, with Alabama, Florida, and 12 other states joining.</p>

                        <p class="summary">Purdue Universitys report indicates that a majority of consumers anticipate continued food price increases, potentially impacting voter sentiment. Despite heightened consumer perception of inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a lower 2.2% increase in food prices over the past year. The report also reveals a political divide in perceived inflation, with Republicans reporting higher rates than Democrats. Consumers may overestimate price changes due to a broader time frame than the CPIs one-month comparison. The report suggests that rising food prices could negatively impact election outcomes, although specific drivers of inflation have diminished. While labor costs remain a lingering factor, the report does not anticipate a return to previous levels of food price inflation.</p>

The meeting focused on a new rule by the Small Business Administration that eases loan restrictions for individuals with criminal records. Harris emphasized the importance of second chances and resources for ex-offenders. President Biden has recently granted clemency to 11 individuals for non-violent drug offenses and commuted the sentences of five others. Bidens reforms aim to address disproportionate sentencing and attract young and minority voters, who advocate for marijuana reform. Kardashians advocacy played a role in elevating the issue during the previous administration.</p>

                        <p class="summary">Ariel Henry, Haitis de facto prime minister, has resigned and appointed Finance Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert as interim prime minister. A nine-person transitional council, including seven voting members, has been sworn in to select Haitis new prime minister and cabinet. The councils swearing-in ceremony occurred amidst gunfire, as gangs have vowed to topple the government. Gangs control most of the capital, cutting it off from the outside world and displacing over 90,000 people. Former Prime Minister Henry is unable to return to Haiti from Los Angeles due to gang-led violence. The transitional council is tasked with paving the way for an international peacekeeping force.</p>

The measure includes separate entrances for tourists and residents, with on-site stewards guiding visitors through the QR code payment process. Despite protests, the program aims to track arrivals more accurately and monitor crowd levels. Critics argue that the fee is ineffective and that the city should focus on increasing the resident population and services to address tourisms negative impact. Venice officials have recorded approximately 10,000 paid day-tripper arrivals on the first day, with over 70,000 others downloading QR codes for exemptions.</p>

Despite the company reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the department, victims relatives believe Boeing avoided criminal charges and are urging prosecutors to hold the company accountable. Although Boeing has paid billions in settlements, the families view the Justice Departments agreement with the company as a betrayal. The families frustration was compounded by a recent incident where a door plug panel blew out of a 737 Max jet, prompting a Justice Department investigation. Prosecutors have yet to provide substantial answers to the families questions, leaving them doubting their concerns are being taken seriously. The Justice Department could extend Boeings probation deal or drop the criminal case altogether within the next two months.</p>

                        <p class="summary">Over 280 musicians, including Billie Eilish, Dave Matthews, and Diplo, have signed a letter urging senators to reform the concert ticketing system. They argue that predatory resellers inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of affordable access. The artists support the Fans First Act, which aims to increase transparency, protect consumers, and deter illegal activities in the ticketing industry. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a co-sponsor of the bill, expressed support for its passage. The letters release comes amidst increased scrutiny of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, following the chaotic sale of Taylor Swift tour tickets and allegations of anti-competitive practices. Lawmakers have introduced multiple bills to address ticketing concerns, and the Justice Department is reportedly investigating Live Nation.</p>

                        <p class="summary">The New York State Court of Appeals overturned Harvey Weinsteins 2020 felony sex crime conviction due to the admission of testimony from women not involved in the case, violating his rights to a fair trial. The court ruled that the testimony from these &#34;Molineux witnesses&#34; unfairly bolstered the credibility of the complainants by emphasizing Weinsteins past behavior. Critics argue that the subjective application of the &#34;Molineux Rule&#34; can lead to challenges to verdicts. The Manhattan district attorneys office intends to retry the case, while Weinstein currently faces a 16-year sentence from a separate Los Angeles conviction. As of now, he is being held in the Mohawk Correctional Facility in upstate New York.</p>

He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and claims Israeli airstrikes have killed other hostages. The video has sparked protests in Israel, with Goldberg-Polins parents urging negotiators to reach a cease-fire to reunite families and end suffering. President Biden and leaders of 17 other countries have issued a joint statement calling on Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal that would include the release of the hostages.</p>
