In Bosnia, dozens of migrants have drowned in the Drina attempting to reach other countries, and their families often struggle to find closure due to lack of information.

Volunteers like Nihad Suljić and Dr. Vidak Simić assist by providing support to families, arranging burials for unidentified bodies, and collecting DNA samples for potential identification.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) offers resources for families to locate missing migrants through the &#34;Trace the Face&#34; virtual photo gallery.

Despite the efforts of volunteers and organizations, many migrant families remain unaware of their loved ones fate and face obstacles in bringing bodies home for burial.

Approximately 29,000 migrants lost their lives along migration routes to Europe between 2014 and 2021, with an additional 5,684 deaths since 2021.</p>

The benefits of these relationships extend into retirement, with warm sibling connections being associated with reduced loneliness and better emotional well-being. Sibling relationships undergo a shift around age 23, becoming more stable and less conflictual. Despite occasional disagreements, it is important to nurture sibling relationships through open communication, understanding perspectives, and establishing clear lines of communication, especially when caring for aging parents.</p>

The PWFA, passed in 2022, requires employers to accommodate employees who are pregnant or postpartum, including providing time off for doctors appointments. The EEOCs implementing regulation includes &#34;abortion&#34; as a related medical condition that employers must accommodate. This has led to opposition from anti-abortion groups and certain lawmakers, who argue that the mandate supports abortion rights. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, seeks to halt the effective date of the regulation and vacate the &#34;abortion-accommodation mandate.&#34; Womens advocates, however, view the lawsuit as an attempt to undermine protections for pregnant workers and womens health. The PWFA received bipartisan support during its passage, and the EEOC has already received complaints alleging violations of the law.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Marjane Satrapi, the renowned graphic novelist, has released her latest book, &#34;Woman, Life, Freedom.&#34; Inspired by the Iranian protests sparked by Mahsa Aminis death, the book collaborates with various artists and intellectuals to depict the uprising and its historical context. Satrapi emphasizes the significance of the protests, particularly the role of young women and the support from young men, as a pushback against the patriarchal culture underpinning Irans regime. The book includes diverse perspectives, such as illustrations by Patricia Bolaños depicting the &#34;noble-born&#34; elite and their disconnect from the struggles of ordinary Iranians. With translations available in English, Persian, and French, Satrapi aims to raise global awareness of the Iranian peoples fight for change. While acknowledging the diasporas support, she stresses that true transformation must come from within Iran.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Speaker Mike Johnson is likely to continue in his role despite a threat by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him. Greene has not yet &#34;privileged&#34; her motion to oust Johnson, which would necessitate a vote within two days. Several Democrats have indicated they would support Johnson in a vote, preventing Greene from gaining enough votes to remove him. Johnsons recent bipartisan support for aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan has boosted his stature and earned him praise from both parties. However, Greenes motion serves as a warning that Johnsons position is tenuous, as Republican speakers have historically faced challenges and short tenures. The current state of Republican politics is highly unstable, and Johnsons tenure echoes the tumultuous history of Republican speakers since World War II, with only one voluntarily leaving office since the 1920s.</p>

                    <p class="summary">On April 27, 1994, South Africans celebrated their first all-race democratic election, ending decades of apartheid oppression. The African National Congress (ANC) won overwhelmingly, with Nelson Mandela becoming the countrys first Black president. This monumental vote marked the beginning of a new era, as millions of Black South Africans exercised their right to vote for the first time.

Three decades later, South Africas &#34;Freedom Day&#34; is still celebrated, commemorating the pivotal election that brought about racial equality. However, the country faces significant socio-economic challenges, including widespread poverty and unemployment. The ANC, which has been in power since 1994, is facing criticism for not improving the lives of many South Africans.

The 30th anniversary of the 1994 election coincides with another potentially transformative event: the upcoming general election on May 29. While the ANC is predicted to remain the largest party, it may lose its parliamentary majority. This could lead to new political alliances and a shift in South Africas political landscape.</p>

The unionized employees primarily work at plants producing Freightliner and Western Star trucks and Thomas Built buses. These gains mirror those obtained by Big 3 autoworkers last fall.

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra noted significant feedback from civil rights and criminal justice organizations. The ban, proposed over two years ago, faced backlash from anti-smoking advocates who argued that its postponement prioritizes politics over public health. Menthol cigarettes, which make up a significant portion of US tobacco sales, are disproportionately marketed to Black communities, women, and LGBTQ populations. Despite the known health risks, particularly the high lung cancer rates among Black smokers, the issue of menthol cigarette bans has divided the Black community, with some civil rights leaders advocating against a ban due to concerns about increased over-policing.</p>

The current protest is part of a wider movement against the Israel-Gaza conflict. However, there are distinctions. The 1968 protests also addressed the Harlem gym issue and included concerns of the Society of Afro-American Students. While police intervention in 1968 resulted in violence, the recent removal of demonstrators was peaceful. Notably, Black students in 1968 asked white students to leave a building due to differences in approach, foreshadowing later divisions among the protesters, including discontent among women regarding their lack of power. Despite the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 1968 protests achieved some success, leading to university policy changes related to research, construction, and military presence.</p>

This move aims to prevent internet service providers from restricting bandwidth, ensuring faster, safer, and more reliable internet connections for consumers. The rules, first introduced in 2015 and repealed under President Trump, prohibit internet service providers from favoring or blocking certain content. The decision is expected to face legal challenges from the telecommunications industry, but will go into effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

                    <p class="summary">In Rafah, Gaza, an airstrike killed a pregnant mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, her husband, and toddler daughter. However, medics successfully performed an emergency cesarean section to deliver her baby girl, who was named Sabreen after her mother. Despite the efforts of medical staff at the Emirati hospital, the premature infant passed away five days later at the age of five. The babys uncle expressed his willingness to care for her, but she was buried alongside her father. The incident occurred amidst an increase in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, where Hamas battalions are said to operate. The Israeli military has not responded to inquiries about why the Jouda familys home was targeted.</p>

                    <p class="summary">In Idaho, the states largest hospital system, St. Lukes, has reported a surge in emergency flights for pregnant patients seeking abortions out of state following the implementation of the states strict abortion ban. However, Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador has questioned these figures, suggesting that St. Lukes may be exaggerating to &#34;make a political statement.&#34;

St. Lukes contends that the flights are necessary to protect patient health and prevent organ damage, while Labrador insists that the law protects doctors and allows abortions in cases where the mothers life is in jeopardy.

The Supreme Court is currently considering the case, with the U.S. government arguing that Idahos law conflicts with the federal mandate requiring hospitals to stabilize patients in emergencies. The Courts ruling on this matter is expected this summer.

Meanwhile, Idaho has experienced an exodus of reproductive health specialists due to the abortion ban, with a study indicating a 22% loss of obstetricians and gynecologists since its enactment.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Across the United States, hundreds of students have been arrested during protests against Israels actions in Gaza. The protests began a week ago after police removed an encampment of demonstrators at Columbia University; however, the students quickly reestablished their encampment. Similar protests have since been organized at schools such as UT Austin and the City College of New York.

The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether former President Donald Trump should be granted immunity from prosecution for his actions after the 2020 election. Trumps lawyers assert that his attempts to stay in power were part of his official duties; however, the majority of the Court seemed skeptical of this argument.

New Yorks top court has overturned the 2020 felony sex crime conviction of Harvey Weinstein, ruling that he did not receive a fair trial. While a new trial has been ordered, Weinstein remains in prison due to a separate conviction from a California trial.

NPRs Steve Inskeep observed several changes in China during a recent visit, noting the increased presence of delivery drivers on electric motorbikes. Inskeep also spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken following a meeting between Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Blinken urged China to stop providing support to Russias defense industry, as it damages relations with European nations who view Russia as a threat. Chinas foreign ministry rejected this advice, claiming hypocrisy from the US for aiding Ukraine while complaining about Chinas trade with Russia. Despite tense relations, both Blinken and Xi agreed on the need for ongoing communication and potential areas of cooperation. Blinken emphasized the importance of restricting access to advanced technology that could be used against the US, while stating that economic decoupling is not the goal. The visit highlighted the contrasting public and private statements from Chinese officials, with public language expressing criticism but private conversations being more constructive. Blinken also addressed concerns over declining US reputation in China, particularly regarding support for Israels conflict with Hamas, and discussed the potential for China to play a constructive role in the Middle East by preventing escalation.</p>

Conservative justices, shaped by their experiences in Republican presidencies, expressed concerns about the potential misuse of criminal law against political opponents. Justice Kavanaugh questioned the application of conspiracy charges against presidential activities, while Justice Gorsuch expressed concerns about targeting political figures based on motives. Justice Alito suggested that criminal immunity for former presidents could foster democratic stability. Chief Justice Roberts, despite his background in the Reagan administration, remained less vocal on the matter. Notably, Justice Barrett, Trumps most recent appointee, challenged the immunity claims, questioning why presidents would be exempt from criminal prosecution compared to Supreme Court justices.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Over 1 million displaced Palestinians in Gazas Rafah are facing the threat of an Israeli military offensive. Israel claims the offensive is necessary to eliminate Hamas and release hostages, but negotiations for a ceasefire have stalled. Multiple officials have expressed concern over the potential civilian death toll, and the US has urged Israel to consider &#34;alternate ways&#34; of addressing the Hamas military presence.

The Israeli military has called up two reserve brigades and erected new tent encampments near Rafah, indicating preparations for an attack. Aid groups and UN agencies fear a humanitarian crisis, as Rafah is the main exit point for wounded Palestinians and humanitarian aid.

Humanitarian organizations have contingency plans for evacuation but lack specific information from Israel. The United Nations reports that hundreds of bodies are still being recovered in Gaza City after an Israeli raid on Al-Shifa hospital. Despite the threat, some displaced Palestinians are considering fleeing to Egypt or returning to Gaza City, as Israeli airstrikes have killed over 230 civilians in Rafah since March 21.</p>

                    <p class="summary">The United Methodist Churchs General Conference has voted to potentially lift the bans on LGBTQ&#43; clergy and same-sex weddings. A regionalization proposal would allow different geographic regions to create their own rules, enabling the U.S. to potentially end such bans while other regions make their own decisions. This move aims to address the disparity in sentiment towards LGBTQ&#43; issues among different parts of the church, particularly between the U.S. and Africa. The regionalization plan passed with 78% of the vote, but needs ratification by local annual conferences. Despite official bans, many local geographic conferences, especially in the U.S., have chosen not to enforce them, leading to departures from the denomination. The regionalization vote could make subsequent proposals to remove the bans globally less contentious.</p>

                    <p class="summary">In Plant City, Florida, the immigration crackdown initiated by Governor Ron DeSantis has resulted in a shortage of farmworkers, causing significant losses for local businesses. Over 40% of farmworkers nationwide are estimated to be undocumented, and the fear of arrest under the new law has led many of them to leave Florida. The Florida Policy Institute estimates the law could cost the states economy $12.6 billion in the first year. Despite the availability of H-2A guest worker programs, farmers face high costs and bureaucratic hurdles that hinder their effectiveness. The labor shortage is also impacting non-agricultural industries, with businesses experiencing difficulties finding workers, particularly in roofing. The law has also created a climate of fear for undocumented workers and their families, leading many of them to consider moving out of Florida.</p>

                    <p class="summary">In the ongoing hush-money trial against former President Trump, David Pecker, ex-publisher of the National Enquirer, testified that Keith Davidson approached the tabloid in 2016 with a story about Karen MacDougal, a model alleging an affair with Trump. Trump instructed Pecker to purchase and suppress the story, which American Media Inc. did at Cohens promise of reimbursement. Peckers testimony supports the prosecutions claim that Trump had direct knowledge of the hush-money payments. The trial also heard details of secret payments and buried stories, providing insight into Trumps methods of controlling information during his 2016 campaign. Peckers actions, motivated by Trumps gratitude, included a dinner at the White House where Trump inquired about MacDougal. Despite Trumps plea of not guilty to charges of falsifying business records, Peckers testimony suggests Trumps involvement in the payments.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that Stallworth was assaulted, strip-searched, and jailed for 15 hours, despite not committing any crimes. Stallworth and her son, Jermari Marshall, are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Andalusias mayor apologized for the incident and stated that Barton was disciplined, but the lawsuit does not specify the nature of the punishment. Stallworths attorney, Harry Daniels, condemned Bartons actions, highlighting the danger posed by officers who disregard citizens rights.</p>

Lawmakers cite fears of China potentially accessing user data, conducting surveillance, and disseminating misinformation. While classified intelligence briefings have raised concerns about TikTok, no evidence has been publicly released.

Chinas efforts to manipulate Americans through social media have intensified, including attempts to influence elections, spread disinformation, and exacerbate existing divisions. While much attention has been given to Russian interference, Chinas efforts are also a growing threat.

TikTok has been utilized in Chinas influence operations, but not more than other platforms like Facebook. However, in Taiwan, China has aggressively used TikTok to undermine democracy, creating proxy accounts to disseminate official state narratives without disclosing their origins.

Despite efforts to sway Taiwanese voters, the pro-independence candidate opposed by China won re-election, indicating that these influence operations have not had a significant impact.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the rules, finalized on Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), exceed the scope of the 2022 Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed with bipartisan support. The regulations, which go into effect on June 18th, allow workers to seek time off to obtain and recover from an abortion. The lawsuit argues that the regulations force employers to accommodate abortions, even if they are illegal under state law. The EEOC maintains that the regulations only provide for time off, which does not have to be paid. The lawsuit was led by Tennessee and Arkansas, with Alabama, Florida, and 12 other states joining.</p>

The report also reveals a political divide in perceived inflation, with Republicans reporting higher rates than Democrats. Consumers may overestimate price changes due to a broader time frame than the CPIs one-month comparison. The report suggests that rising food prices could negatively impact election outcomes, although specific drivers of inflation have diminished.

                    <p class="summary">Venice has introduced a pilot program requiring day-trippers to pay a €5 entry fee between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. on specific dates through July to reduce overtourism and improve livability for residents. The measure includes separate entrances for tourists and residents, with on-site stewards guiding visitors through the QR code payment process. Despite protests, the program aims to track arrivals more accurately and monitor crowd levels. Critics argue that the fee is ineffective and that the city should focus on increasing the resident population and services to address tourisms negative impact. Venice officials have recorded approximately 10,000 paid day-tripper arrivals on the first day, with over 70,000 others downloading QR codes for exemptions.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Families of victims killed in two 737 Max jet crashes in 2018 and 2019 met with Justice Department prosecutors and expressed frustration over the lack of criminal prosecution against Boeing. Despite the company reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the department, victims relatives believe Boeing avoided criminal charges and are urging prosecutors to hold the company accountable. Although Boeing has paid billions in settlements, the families view the Justice Departments agreement with the company as a betrayal. The families frustration was compounded by a recent incident where a door plug panel blew out of a 737 Max jet, prompting a Justice Department investigation. Prosecutors have yet to provide substantial answers to the families questions, leaving them doubting their concerns are being taken seriously. The Justice Department could extend Boeings probation deal or drop the criminal case altogether within the next two months.</p>

                    <p class="summary">Over 280 musicians, including Billie Eilish, Dave Matthews, and Diplo, have signed a letter urging senators to reform the concert ticketing system. They argue that predatory resellers inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of affordable access. The artists support the Fans First Act, which aims to increase transparency, protect consumers, and deter illegal activities in the ticketing industry. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a co-sponsor of the bill, expressed support for its passage. The letters release comes amidst increased scrutiny of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, following the chaotic sale of Taylor Swift tour tickets and allegations of anti-competitive practices. Lawmakers have introduced multiple bills to address ticketing concerns, and the Justice Department is reportedly investigating Live Nation.</p>

                    <p class="summary">The New York State Court of Appeals overturned Harvey Weinsteins 2020 felony sex crime conviction due to the admission of testimony from women not involved in the case, violating his rights to a fair trial. The court ruled that the testimony from these &#34;Molineux witnesses&#34; unfairly bolstered the credibility of the complainants by emphasizing Weinsteins past behavior. Critics argue that the subjective application of the &#34;Molineux Rule&#34; can lead to challenges to verdicts. The Manhattan district attorneys office intends to retry the case, while Weinstein currently faces a 16-year sentence from a separate Los Angeles conviction. As of now, he is being held in the Mohawk Correctional Facility in upstate New York.</p>

The video marks the first time Hamas has released a video of one of the five Americans it holds captive. Goldberg-Polin, 24, appears in the video with a healed stump where his left forearm was amputated. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and claims Israeli airstrikes have killed other hostages. The video has sparked protests in Israel, with Goldberg-Polins parents urging negotiators to reach a cease-fire to reunite families and end suffering. President Biden and leaders of 17 other countries have issued a joint statement calling on Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal that would include the release of the hostages.</p>
