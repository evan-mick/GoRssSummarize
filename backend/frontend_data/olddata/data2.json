The lawsuit alleges that the rules, finalized on Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), exceed the scope of the 2022 Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed with bipartisan support. The regulations, which go into effect on June 18th, allow workers to seek time off to obtain and recover from an abortion. The lawsuit argues that the regulations force employers to accommodate abortions, even if they are illegal under state law. The EEOC maintains that the regulations only provide for time off, which does not have to be paid. The lawsuit was led by Tennessee and Arkansas, with Alabama, Florida, and 12 other states joining.","timeAdded":"2024-04-26T04:14:16Z","timePublished":"2024-04-25T21:11:05Z","photoUrl":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/04/25/ap24116849011157_slide-d8632fafae25efdd5bdf1f523b239af88a3777da-s1100-c50.jpg"},{"url":"https://npr.org/2024/04/25/1247177492/why-experts-say-inflation-is-relatively-low-but-voters-feel-differently","title":"Why experts say inflation is relatively low but voters feel differently","fromWeb":"NPR","summary":"Purdue Universitys report indicates that a majority of consumers anticipate continued food price increases, potentially impacting voter sentiment. Despite heightened consumer perception of inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a lower 2.2% increase in food prices over the past year. The report also reveals a political divide in perceived inflation, with Republicans reporting higher rates than Democrats. Consumers may overestimate price changes due to a broader time frame than the CPIs one-month comparison. The report suggests that rising food prices could negatively impact election outcomes, although specific drivers of inflation have diminished. While labor costs remain a lingering factor, the report does not anticipate a return to previous levels of food price inflation.","timeAdded":"2024-04-26T04:14:17Z","timePublished":"2024-04-25T16:49:55Z","photoUrl":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/04/25/gettyimages-2008640078_wide-a45766cb5f08807ed26cf28b1f194c22407ac6c5-s1100-c50.jpg"},{"url":"https://npr.org/2024/04/25/1247183807/kim-kardashian-white-house-criminal-justice-reform","title":"Kim Kardashian visits the White House to highlight criminal justice reform","fromWeb":"NPR","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris met with reality TV star Kim Kardashian to discuss criminal justice reform.
